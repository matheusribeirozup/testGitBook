# FAQ

#### What is Beagle?

Beagle is a **cross-platform framework** which facilitates usage of the **Server-Driven UI** concept, **natively** in iOS and Android. By using Beagle, your team could easily change application's layout and data by just changing back-end code.

#### How Beagle works?

The developer declares screens on the backend and exposes endpoints that represent those screens. In mobile, these endpoints are called using the beagle to render the components on the screen.

#### Will my app architecture change if I use Beagle?

No, the beagle is an agnostic of architecture, and does not interfere in the structure of the project where it is used.

#### Why use Beagle instead of using React Native or Flutter?

The problem that Beagle is ready to solve is different from these other technologies. Beagle is a tool to facilitate development taking into account the concept of Server Driven UI and Continuous Delivery. React Native and Flutter are tools for creating multi-platform mobile applications. Beagle allows you to manipulate, through the backend, native components of your application.

#### Can I use beagle in an application that already has several features developed?

Yes, including reusing the design system components if they are defined in a componentized way natively on each platform. This way, these components can be used natively without and / or with a beagle.

#### Does an app using beagle have to be 100% server driven?

No. They can be used in some streams of your app, and from within the server driven stream it is possible to go back to a native screen.

#### Am I required to use Beagle in the entire application?

No, you can make native parts together with flows using Beagle.

#### Will my app work offline?

Yes, One way to handle cases of disconnection is to build local declarative screens for fallback.

#### Will I have problems to upload the app with beagle in the App Store or Play Store?

No, since all of its components are already defined in the application, there is no dynamic content to the point of justifying a block by Apple or Google on climbs to the store.

#### Will the beagle have performance problems?

We did a rendering benchmark and the Beagle that uses the Yoga Layout engine was even ahead of native rendering strategies like Auto Layout \(IOS\) and Constraint Layout \(Android\)

#### But what about backend call times?

To optimize calls to the backend, the beagle uses a cache mechanism to store the screens adjacent to the current screen and thus does not need to request the backend at the moment of the user's click.

#### What is the current version of Beagle?

The current version is 0.0.16
